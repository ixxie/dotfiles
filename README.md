## [ixxie](https://shenhav.fyi)'s dotfiles

This repo stores my dotfiles, organized as a [NixOS](https://nixos.org) config in a Nix flake, with
[Home-Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) installed [as a NixOS module](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#sec-install-nixos-module).

### philosophy

- **declarative** - configure as much as possible in these files
- **lazy** - avoid things that require too much config and effort
- **neat** - keep it visually and programmatically tidy

### desktop

- [**Niri**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) - scrolling tiling compositor
- [**Noctalia**](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell) - wayland shell w/ bar, launcher & notifications
- [**Stylix**](https://nix-community.github.io/stylix/) - system-wide theming

I also keep a [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) desktop as a backup.

### shell

- [**Helix**](https://helix-editor.com/) - modal text editor
- [**Ghostty**](https://ghostty.org/) - terminal emulator
- [**Nushell**](https://www.nushell.sh/) - data-orientated shell
